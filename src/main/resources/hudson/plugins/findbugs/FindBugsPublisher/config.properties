             		setting that specifies the generated raw FindBugs XML report files, such as '**/findbugs.xml'. \
             		Basedir of the fileset is <a href='ws/'>the workspace root</a>. \
             		If no value is set, then the default '**/findbugs.xml' is used. Be sure not to include any \
    		 		non-report files into this pattern.
description.threshold=If the number of potential bugs exceeds this threshold then a build is \
           			  considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
           			  should not be touched by this plug-in.
description.healthy=Configure health reporting thresholds. If the actual number of warnings is between \
             		the provided thresholds, then the healthiness is interpolated.
description.height=Height of the trend report image (in pixels). Leave this field empty to use the default height.
